# Azure AD / Microsoft Entra ID

## Powershell

```dsregcmd /status```

It is a vital Windows command-line tool to check a device's registration and authentication status with Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) and Active Directory, revealing join types (Azure AD, Hybrid, Domain), device IDs, SSO status (Primary Refresh Token), and diagnostic data, crucial for IT troubleshooting. Running dsregcmd /status in Command Prompt or PowerShell provides a comprehensive report on whether a device is correctly joined, managed, and can authenticate, helping diagnose issues with sign-ins, compliance, and device management.
